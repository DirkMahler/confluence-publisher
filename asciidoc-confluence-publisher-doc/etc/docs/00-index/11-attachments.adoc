= Attachments

If an AsciiDoc file references a non-AsciiDoc file (e.g. a text file, PDF, ...) that non-AsciiDoc file is automatically
added as an attachment to the corresponding Confluence page. Referenced non-AsciiDoc files are resolved relative to the
location of the referencing AsciiDoc file.

Attachment links may specify a label:

[listing]
....
link:../files/attachment.txt[Attachment]
....

link:../files/attachment.txt[Attachment]


If no label is specified, the attachment filename is used as the label:

[listing]
....
link:../files/attachment.txt[]
....

link:../files/attachment.txt[]

If the attachment filename contains special characters such as spaces, the attachment filename has to be URL-encoded:

[listing]
....
link:../files/attachment%20with%20space%20in%20filename.txt[Attachment with space in filename]
....

link:../files/attachment%20with%20space%20in%20filename.txt[Attachment with space in filename]
