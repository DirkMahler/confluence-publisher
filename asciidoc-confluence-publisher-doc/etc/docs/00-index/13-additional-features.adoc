== Collapsible Example Blocks

AsciiDoc collapsible example blocks are translated to Confluence with help of the expand macro.

[listing]
....
[%collapsible]
====
This content is revealed when the label is clicked.
====
....

[%collapsible]
====
This content is revealed when the label is clicked.

An optional block title can be specified:

[listing]
....
.Toggle Me
[%collapsible]
====
This content is revealed when the "Toggle Me" label is clicked.
====
....

.Toggle Me
[%collapsible]
====
This content is revealed when the "Toggle Me" label is clicked.
====

[NOTE]
====
Non-collapsible example blocks are currently converted to a tip admonition, since Confluence does not provide any
specified example element.

[NOTE]
====
Using the `open` option on collapsible expand blocks is currently not supported.
